What is RemovePrivatFlags:

RemovePrivatFlags.exe will remove the privat flags from all items in a mailbox.

Requirements:
- Exchange Server 2013 (Tested with CU15, maybe it will work with Exchange 2007/2010 as well)
- Application Impersonisation rights

The program can run on any client and will connect to the exchange via autodiscover. At this time there is no possibillity to specify a single server.

Logging:
Logs will be created in the folders logs\. You can change the logging in the xml file RemovePrivateFlag.exe.config. The default loglevel is INFO.
For more log spamming change it to DEBUG. You can change also the path where the logs will be stored.

Filtering:
You can filter the search if you set -foldername. Ex: "Inbox\Testfolder" would only search under "Inbox\Testfolder" (and "Inbox\Testfolder\Example).
"Test" will be search in all folders where the folderpath contains "Test" (So "Inbox\Test" as well as "Inbox\Testfolder" and "\Test" will be used 
for the search):

Parameters:
not optiional: -mailbox user@domain.com
optional: -logonly true
optional: -foldername "Inbox"
optional: -noconfirmation true

How to run:
RemovePrivateFlags.exe -mailbox user@domain.com [-logonly true] [-foldername "Inbox"]
Search through the mailbox and ask for changing a item if -logonly is not set to true. If -foldername is given the folder path are compared to the folder name.
If -logonly is set to true only a log will be created.

RemovePrivateFlags.exe -mailbox user@domain.com [-foldername "Inbox"] [-noconfirmation true]
Search through the mailbox, if -noconfirmation is set to true all items will be altered without confirmation.
